                    Thor Odinson, more commonly known as Thor, and sometimes by
                    his title as the God of Thunder, is a fictional character
                    portrayed by Chris Hemsworth in the Marvel Cinematic
                    Universe (MCU) media franchise, based on the Marvel Comics
                    character of the same name and the Norse mythological god
                    of the same name. In the MCU, he is depicted as one of the
                    most powerful Asgardians, an ancient alien civilization
                    with long ties to Earth, who humans consider to be gods.
                    Thor wields a powerful hammer called Mjolnir, and is
                    initially depicted as the arrogant heir to the throne
                    of Asgard whose brash behaviors causes turmoil among
                    the Nine Realms under Asgard's protection.
                    This brings him into conflict with his villainous adopted
                    brother, Loki. Thor commits himself to the protection of Earth,
                    and becomes a founding member of the Avengers.
                    Thor eventually becomes the King of Asgard after Odin's death,
                    but the entire realm is destroyed during Ragnar√∂k. Following
                    the Blip, he passes the crown of New Asgard to Valkyrie
                    and joins the Guardians of the Galaxy.

                    Iron Man is a superhero appearing in American comic
                    books published by Marvel Comics. The character was
                    co-created by writer and editor Stan Lee, developed by
                    scripter Larry Lieber, and designed by artists Don Heck
                    and Jack Kirby. The character made his first appearance
                    in Tales of Suspense #39 (cover dated March 1963),
                    and received his own title in Iron Man(May 1968).
                    Also in 1963, the character founded the Avengers alongside
                    Thor, Ant-Man, Wasp and the Hulk.
                    A wealthy American business magnate, playboy,
                    philanthropist, inventor and ingenious scientist,
                    Anthony Edward Stark suffers a severe chest injury
                    during a kidnapping. When his captors attempt to force
                    him to build a weapon of mass destruction, he instead
                    creates a mechanized suit of armor to save his life
                    and escape captivity. Later, Stark develops his suit,
                    adding weapons and other technological devices he
                    designed through his company, Stark Industries.
                    He uses the suit and successive versions to protect
                    the world as Iron Man. Although at first concealing
                    his true identity, Stark eventually publicly reveals
                    himself to be Iron Man.
